## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a dedicated and curious lifelong learner with a unique background that blends education and technology. For over 7 years, I’ve worked as a Japanese language teacher, helping students gain confidence in communication and cross-cultural understanding. Now, I’m channeling that same passion for learning and teaching into the world of Artificial Intelligence.

After years of empowering others through language, I’ve discovered a new calling in AI and Machine Learning—where I can solve real-world problems, automate tasks, and create meaningful impact through data-driven technologies. Currently, I'm focusing on building a strong foundation in Python and expanding my skills in math, machine learning, and AI fundamentals.
